#VERSION NOTES

continue to add functionality to modules and define functions and methods with goal of finishing report building phase. be ready to import data once complete.

addign teams and games mannually, can evaluate game, assign credits, generate rankings and reports, and print to console. All functional so far.

Just clean up and make sure everything we want is there then we can start creating module(s) to parse html and fetch data from online sources.

Note: yard margin will always show zero until we actually assign yards earned and against to a team right now that list is empty.

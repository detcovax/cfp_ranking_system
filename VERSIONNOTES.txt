#VERSION NOTES

I have a full ist of all schools retrieved from parsing the NCAA.com site for all schools. I can now use this list to request base info from NCAA.com about each school. This info would be things like division, conference, and roster.

.................................................

Been playing aroudn with the fetch modeling. I want to be certain the form of the data stored is useful in the most effective way for the goals right now.

.................................................

Begin fetch module build. We want to have an idea what formating we want for the data storage so we can request the correct data from our web scraping. NCAA.com has alot of great data that we can request but first how do we want to break it down and are we going to pull that data by team, by game, or by player? Then how do we connect everything up inside the Team module? This line of thinking shoudl clear up structure questions and allow us to start thinking in terms of our first requests.

.................................................

Basic reporting strucutre is in place. Time to start building data fetching module.
Once data fetch is complete we need to clean and store the data for later use.

.................................................

most of the basic report printing and ranking structure is in place.
just need to continue to iterate on the ranking equations, and determine what data is needed before I begin to build the data fetch.

.................................................

looking to modify how powerIndex and rankings are generated.
We want the power index to be mostly based on wins/losses and points margin withing wins/losses to just rank the SOR basically against each other.
Then we will use game results against powerindex to generate the rankings. based on this idea though of assigning credits based on points scored against powerful opponents, we want to include more data in the power index to actually rank team based on "ability to perform" and then the rankings will be a more accurate "did you actually perform".
Take notes from original test version to see how this was done, it did a pretty good job.

Notes: output prints to txt file now.

.................................................

continue to add functionality to modules and define functions and methods with goal of finishing report building phase. be ready to import data once complete.

addign teams and games mannually, can evaluate game, assign credits, generate rankings and reports, and print to console. All functional so far.

Just clean up and make sure everything we want is there then we can start creating module(s) to parse html and fetch data from online sources.

Note: yard margin will always show zero until we actually assign yards earned and against to a team right now that list is empty.

.................................................

working on adding in game module.
continuing to build out team module and report method. continuing to consider refactoring of main module to keep code light and clean.

CFP Ranking System Project in Python


This is a personal project I call the CFP Ranking System, where I am developing a sophisticated ranking algorithm for college football programs using Python. This involves using techniques in data parsing, cleaning, and metric generation from game results, while integrating with public data sources to ensure unbiased comparisons among Division I NCAA football teams. Additionally, I am automating the generation of comprehensive team rankings and metrics in a user-friendly format. This project not only showcases my proficiency in data analysis and Python programming but also demonstrates my strategic thinking in delivering actionable insights through advanced statistical analysis. As an avid sports fan this project allows me to enhance my viewing experience by providing powerful and impactful insights into the outcomes of events both real and hypothetical.

Feel free to use this code as you wish :)
